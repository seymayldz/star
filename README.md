My repository for my RT-qPCR studies

I work in the chromatin biology and epigenetics lab. RT-qPCR is one of my most frequent analyzes.

I get the CT value result for each sample I made from the RT-qPCR device.
In these examples, I do 3 repetitions. To control myself.
First i have to take the average of these 3 checks (CT means). Then I have to find their standard deviation. Finally, let me find my standard error.
Then I need to compare my control target with other target CT means. I calculate D CT, DD CT and Fold Change between these two targets.
Then i show this fold cahange on a histogram graph. So I can better monitor the change.

I am doing this work with formulas on excel (=like average).

I would like to write some code for it as I do this analysis very often.
According to my research, it is possible to write such codes through the R program.
I will try to write this code after learning R.
